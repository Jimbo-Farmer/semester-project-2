## Description

- This is a school project to design and build an ecommerce site for shoes. 
- I decided on a casual shoe site with a retro vibe. 
- An admin user can log in and create/update/delete products. 

## Build details

- Content management (CMS) uses Wordpress in headless mode.
- HTML, SCSS, Javascript are used for the frontend. 

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open in a code editor.
3. If using VSCode: Choose an html page, right click and run with live server.
4. A sass compiler will be needed for editing the styling, I used the livesass compiler plugin for VSCode.  

## Licensing/Copyright etc

- I don't own any of the images - they were obtained from places like unsplash/pixabay under CC licences.
- You can use whatever you want (code/ logo/ colour scheme etc).
